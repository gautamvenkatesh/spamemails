# spamemails

This is the code I used to make a website that shows my emails, filters out spam emails, and sends a daily email with all the spam received in the previous 24 hours
This code is not meant for public use, and is merely to showcase my work

The code uses the django framework.
The spam filter used will be updated to use a machine learning classification soon.
